# Matroid-Secretary-Paper

# My Project

To briefly introduce this project, I will say that it is an analysis and proof of teh matroid secretary problem, which is an extension of the secretary problem. In the original problem, the task is to choose the best secretary out of n applicants. Once you see an applicant, you must immediately accept or reject. The matroid version is a bit more complex, but follows the same principle. The main objective of this paper is to prove the O(log(log(rank)) approach and search for methods that can improve this runtime.
